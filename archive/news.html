<title>Dan Gribbin</title>
<meta NAME="description" CONTENT="Welcome to the website of Dan Gribbin, singer/songwriter/guitarist.  Dan's original compositions offer a mix of environmental folk music, social satire, and blues with the occasional country, rock, or pop number thrown in for seasoning.  Dan lives in Daytona Beach Shores but often plays for Sunday services at the UU church in Ormond Beach.  Winner of the 2004 Comic Song of the Year award (from Songwriters Showcase of America) and the 2017 Funny Song Contest at the Lake County Folk Festival, Dan does commit humor on a regular basis.  He performs at the Will McLean Festival and does the occasional concert at the Bermuda Aquarium and Zoo.  Dan also sings with the folk revival trio Work Release Program, covering songs by The Kingston Trio and other folk favorites.  His fourth CD, "Florida in My Soul," was released in July 2018.">

It's $10 per person, and seating is limited.<br />
<br />
I'll be playing forty-five minutes of music on Monday evening, Dec. 16, at the Halifax River Audubon monthly meeting.  This is at 7 pm in Sica Hall, across from City Hall on Daytona Avenue in Holly Hill, FL.  See "Events" on my website home page for directions.<br />
<br />
Next concert at Osteen Diner will be on Saturday evening, Dec. 28, 6-8 pm.  One great benefit of these concerts is that I do take requests from my extensive sheet that circulates in the room.  It was here that I learned how popular is "Bridge Over Troubled Waters."  It sounds beautiful when people sing along, as we have demonstrated at UU Marion County and UU Ormond Beach.<br />

(Directions below.)  I have written several new songs, and it will be great to be able to share them with you.  I'll also bring along some of my shore bird note cards (see a selection at www.danbirds.com), and if you'll say the magic words when you arrive ("black skimmers"), you'll receive 1/3 off on a box of cards, as well as a free card of your choice.  (Didn't Groucho Marx originate the secret word idea?  And with a bird, no less, but not a black skimmer.)  I've been up at dawn several days this past week to good effect-lots of new and interesting cards.  But speaking of music, see the note below about a concert featuring Martha solo, as well as accompanying me.  Now we're talking!  See you on the 26th.  Dan.<br />

 <br />
February 26 (Saturday):  Osteen Diner.  Dan performs from 6-8 pm.  Original music and your requests (see list below of what I'm practicing in the way of cover tunes).  See this website under "Events" for details about the diner.  It's south of Rt. 44 on Tomoka Farms Rd.  Exact location is 195 South State Road 415, Osteen, FL, just south of the new Wal-mart and Skip's, across the street from Dollar General.  Phone: 407-323-6469 or 407-304-0111.<br />

 <br />
May 14 (Saturday):  Unitarian Universalist Society, Ormond Beach.  Martha Brandt and Dan Gribbin will be featured in a Littner Series concert from 6-8 pm.  Martha will play solo, then Dan will join her for some of his original songs, and then Dan will play solo.  Coffee house atmosphere with sandwiches and drinks available.  56 N.

____________________________<br />
 <br />
Request list:  The tunes marked with (*) are those that I'm devoting special attention to in preparation for the Osteen Diner concert (some of them in quick medley versions), but if you see something else on the list that you'd like to hear, do e-mail me a warning.  Of course, you could sit tight and just watch me squirm when you request it.  You know I'll play it for you, anyway, while sweating bullets.  : )  I'll be doing original songs, too, of course.<br />

								<span class="greyed">The summer has brought opportunities for working with young singers and songwritersand I do mean young.  As a volunteer at the Bermuda Aquarium during the week of July 20th, I had the pleasure of working with four different groups of AquaCampers ranging in age from 5 to 14.  The kids and I then entertained their families at a Friday evening concert and picnic, singing about creatures from Bermudas mangrove swamps and freshwater ponds.  Our own Camp Creative UU hosted two different sets of day campers whom I taught songs by Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, as well as some that we cooked up on our own to share at the end of the week potluck dinner.  Now we look forward to good music in the Fall, with a concert at Olivias in Eustis followed by an established folk festival in Eustis and a new one in Ormond Beach.  Hope to see you there.  Dan.<br />

SPECIAL NOTE:  If you would like to participate in an Elderhostel class that I will be teaching at Stetson, Nov. 8  13, on The Sixties Folk Revival, please call 1-877-426-8056 and tell them to sign you up.  (Info about Elderhostel in general can be found at <www.elderhostel.org>).  I spoke with the people at Stetson today, and they are concerned that Elderhostel registration is running slow, as a result of the poor economy.  Ive enjoyed teaching UCF courses in the evolution of folk music and folk values in America, and Id love to work with these ideas in an Elderhostel class, so if you have some interest, please check out this opportunity.  <br />

Its a beautiful day in America, and we hope youll join Martha and me to celebrate the Inaugural this evening (Tuesday) at Cuvee in Ormond Beach.

Many of you are familiar with Angell & Phelps, the wonderful restaurant in downtown Daytona Beach. Last night, I received an offer from Harold Blanchard, a world reknowned jazz pianist, to play a few numbers during his breaks as he entertains at Angell & Phelps.  I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to hear Harold and to show the management that we love good music in Daytona Beach. Dan.<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
--Dec. 5 (Friday) Dan will perform during Harold Blanchards breaks at Angell & Phelps on Beach St.  It is a real privilege to have the chance to play for him and for you at this wonderful restaurant in downtown Daytona Beach. Harold will probably begin a set at about 7 pm, so I imagine I would begin playing sometime between 7:30 and 8 pm.  156 S. Beach St., Daytona.  Reservations: 386-257-2677. www.angellandphelpscafe.com<br />

After a bump in the road at midweek (Note to Self: Avoid musical traffic on US1), things smoothed out considerably. Our good friends from Pelican Bay returned from Germany and surprised us at Java Jungle. Our Victoria Park connection dropped by Cuvée in Ormond Beach for Sunday brunch. And thanks to considerable help from our Riverview friends, the audition on Thursday evening went very wellIve been invited to play up front in the snazzy restaurant area at Hollywood Cantina. Well look for you there on Friday evening!  Dan.<br />

Were taking the weekend off this week to participate in the Autumn Harvest program at the Unitarian Universalist Society in Ormond Beach, but next week Ill be playing at two new venues during the week, followed by the usual Sunday Brunch at Cuvée (Nov. 23) on the heels of a Saturday evening concert at Java Jungle.<br />
<br />
The first new venue features Greek food, as well as more traditional favorites.  Thats US1 Restaurant and Grille on Ridgewood in South Daytona.  (Gordon says that Frederika is cooking there.)  The second new spot is a downtown club and restaurant, Hollywood Cantina, on Beach St. in the block north of ISB.  This one has decor as modern as the US1s is traditional, so take your pick!<br />
<br />
If we dont see you at the UU this weekend, well look forward to seeing you for some music next week.  Dan.<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
--Nov. 19 (Wed) Dan plays at US1 Restaurant and Grille, 2842 S. Ridgewood, just north of Rinker materials and just south of Reed Canal Rd.  7-9 pm.  Very nice, understated decor.  Greek specials as well as traditional English dishes.  www.us1restaurantgrill.com.  386-767-3471.<br />

Two musical opportunities this weekend, with Sunday Brunch at Cuvée on the heels of a Saturday evening concert at Java Jungle.  Both are fine venues, so take your pick, or double your pleasure.<br />
<br />
We bid fond farewell to the Brooklyn Ice Caffé, which has been sold to be converted to a sports bar.  Good luck to Phil, Stacey, Sharon, and Dawn, whove been so hospitable to us during these past two months.<br />
<br />
The Barberville festival drew a record crowd on Saturday and featured wonderful music all weekend.  It was great to see so many of you there.  Joel, Margie, and I are looking forward to our next outdoor venture, the Central Florida Folk concert in Langford Park in December.  (Details below.)<br />
<br />
Martha and I will look forward to seeing you in the jungle on Saturday night or at the brunch after church on Sunday.  Bring your requests, or hum a few bars and well try it!  Dan.<br />

Thanks for the wonderful support at Cuvée, this past Sunday.  That was my busiest weekend of music ever, and it was so gratifying to have such a wonderful audience at the final event, our Sunday brunch.  Well do that again on Nov. 9.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ill be doing the early show on Halloween Night (this Friday) at Brooklyn Ice Caffé, so come on out and well do some spooky music.  (How about The Cat Came Back?)  Our host and manager Phil says hes pulling out all stops to draw in some business, so hes scheduled an act after mine.  Come for dinner at 7 to get in on the musical fun, since Ill be finishing up my end of the program at 9.  See you there!  Dan.<br />

Theres a full schedule of music on tap, this weekend, Friday at Brooklyn Ice Caffé, Saturday at Java Jungle, and Sunday Brunch at Cuvée.  Ill look for you at one of more of these fine venues.  It was fun to see how many of you sang along to Green Door when I performed it last Friday night.  That song dates back to 1956I heard it on the first radio I ever owned.  Ill leave it in the act, along with Bridge Over Troubled Water, which is, of course, of more recent vintage1970.  In case youd like to give a CD or two as holiday gifts, see ordering instructions below.  Meanwhile, see you this weekend.  Dan.<br />

Sunday Brunch at Cuveé worked out so well, with wonderful support from the Ormond Beach fan base, that Ive been invited to play on several Sundays through the fall and winter (Oct. 26 will be the next Sunday).

Meanwhile, come on over to Eustis for the free Lake County Folk Festival.  Its a beautiful setting in a lakefront park, and lots of good music spread out over Saturday and Sunday.

The evening concert at Cuveé turned into quite a party, so lets do it again for Sunday Brunch after church.  The restaurant is just up the block (east on Granada) from the Unitarian Church in Ormond (parking directions below).  And since the debate kept many of you at home last Friday, please come out to Brooklyn Ice Caffe this Friday to support this fine restaurant.  You might even drop by Juva Jungle on Saturday for coffee and dessert treats.  Hope to see you!  Dan.<br />

								<span class="greyed">What a turnout at the Brooklyn Ice Caffe!  We filled the music room and had the owner and manager beaming. And Phil has been nice enough to allow me to switch to Saturday, this week, so that the concert wont conflict with the monthly UU pot luck dinner. So well be getting underway at 7:30 on Saturday evening, and it looks as if it might be good to come early to avoid being seated in the balcony.  : )   See you then! <br />

Responding to recommendations from several of you, Ive secured a booking for a Friday evening concert at the Brooklyn Ice Caffe in Port Orange. It looks like a fine place to dine and enjoy the music. The owner wants to make me a regular, but that means that well have to turn out in numbers, since hell be sharpening his pencil and counting up the receipts generated between 8 and 10 pm while Im playing. Im up for the challenge, and Im confident of your support. Lets continue the good time we had at Java Jungle this past weekend, as we step across the street to enjoy the hospitable atmosphere of our friends from Flatbush. Bring your kazoo and well really liven the place up!<br />

What a wonderful gathering at Java Jungle last Saturday evening! Thats the kind of crackerjack crowd that brings out the best in a performer, and I thank you all for making it such a fine evening. Hope to see you there again Saturday, or at Sorrentos (Wed) or Lake Helen Coffee & Tea (Fri). I appreciate your making requests for some of the favorites from the CDs, since a songwriter tends to get caught up in performing new material, and its fun to reach back for an earlier song. And thanks again to those of you who have suggested venues to investigate. Ill be checking out two Ormond Beach possibilities this week. I think we can officially consider me to be retired from teaching and working full-time as a self-employed musician. Lets remember to sing Pete Seegers ode to aging Get Up and Go at the concerts this week.   <br />

<br />
--Jul 23 (Wed) Dan plays at Sorrento Pizza & Deli.  6-8 pm.  Located in Port Orange Plaza, the little shopping center on the southwest corner of the intersection of US1 and Dunlawton (4050 S. Ridgewood).  The restaurant is in the right angle of the L-shaped center, tucked in to the right of the video store.  Great food!  386-761-2181.<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
--July 25 (Fri) Dan will perform on the patio at Lake Helen Coffee & Tea from 6 - 8 pm.  This is a Summer Nights series event, and Ill actually probably begin a little earlieraround 5:30.  The kitchen will remain open for the concert, and we are advised to bring a lawn chair.  (I think Ill stick with my trustee unpadded bar stool, but youll probably want something more comfortable.)  Located in Lake Helen at 360 S. Lakeview Ave.  Phone: 386-951-4486.<br />

The folks at Java Jungle seem to have liked what they heard on Satuday evening. Thanks to those of you who came to check out this new venue. Well do it again this Saturday, and they are billing this as the actual Grand Opening and putting out some publicity, so well hope to fill the jungle with interesting cats. (Now theres a beatnik term I havent used in while.) Maybe we should play that old Martin Denny instrumental Quiet Village in honor of this setting. Ill be looking for you on Saturday, primed and ready to take your requests.  <br />

My call for suggestions about places that you might like to hear me play has yielded immediate results. A new and very intriguing coffee house, Java Jungle, is holding its grand opening this weekend, and Ill be performing there on Saturday night. (They actually signed me up for the next two Saturdaysa very welcome act of good faith.) They have the usual array of coffee bar drinks along with some serious dessert offerings, and the setting includes waterfalls and a listening room away from the noise of the coffee mixers. I think were going to like this place, folks!<br />

Our evening at the HotSpot Coffee Shoppe proved to be a terrific experience.  Marcia took photos and has posted them to the shoppes website, so be sure to check them out.  Well look forward to playing there again soon.  This week, its a Wednesday night concert at Sorrentos, so bring your appetite and your requests and well look for you as we dodge the drops of much-needed rain.  <br />
<br />

This is the week to extend your horizons and visit (or re-visit) The Hot Spot Coffee Shoppe on Saturday night at 7 for good music (Ill handle that part), good food (Gus serves up great sandwiches, wraps, wonderful desserts), and refreshing drinks (Italian sodas recommended). Its a gem of a place right here in Daytona Beach on US 1 (i.e. Ridgewood) near Beville Rd. Lets show Marcia (did you see her in the paper last week?) and Gus how good taste (theyre inviting us, right?) can be rewarded with a great crowd. Im totally ready to introduce you to my sweet little new song The Moon and a Few High Clouds, so remind me to play it as soon as youre settled in with your food and drink. ____________________________<br />
<br />
--Jun 28 (Sat) As indicated above, Dan will perform at The Hot Spot Coffee Shoppe at 1216 S. Ridgewood in Daytona Beach.  Beginning at 7 pm.  This is a solo concert with a $3 cover charge. 386-236-0517.  www.HotSpotCoffeeShoppe.com.<br />

<br />
--Jun 29 (Sun) Dan will perform Leonard Cohens Joan of Arc as the offertory during the Sunday service at the Unitarian Universalist Society in Ormond Beach. One of our favorite speakers,  Dr. Jim Shoopman from Embry-Riddle Aeronautic University, will deliver the message on A New Look at Women in the Bible. Lots of very fine people at the UU, and wonderful music by our stellar pianist Carol Beck Belden.  www.uuormond.net<br />

If you'll  click on the photo on the website, here, you'll see that  we were driven indoors by light rain for the Animal Singsong at the Bermuda Aquarium June 6), but that only added a bit of extra atmosphere to the proceedings.  Performing in front of the colorful coral reef, I was ably assisted by Gabriel Jones, my 6-year-old ambassador to the younger members of the audience, as we entertained more than 100 people in the main hall of this beautiful facility.  We spread the gospel of environmental awareness and wildlife preservation in Bermuda all week, with several news articles and interviews prior to the concert.  We had a wonderful time with our Bermudian friends and will hope to do it again next summer.<br />
<br />
 And now back to our regularly scheduled Florida music!<br />

If you'll  click on the photo on the website, here, you'll see that  we were driven indoors by light rain for the Animal Singsong at the Bermuda Aquarium June 6), but that only added a bit of extra atmosphere to the proceedings.  Performing in front of the colorful coral reef, I was ably assisted by Gabriel Jones, my 6-year-old ambassador to the younger members of the audience, as we entertained more than 100 people in the main hall of this beautiful facility.  We spread the gospel of environmental awareness and wildlife preservation in Bermuda all week, with several news articles and interviews prior to the concert.  We had a wonderful time with our Bermudian friends and will hope to do it again next summer.<br />
<br />
 And now back to our regularly scheduled Florida music!<br />

								<span class="greyed">LOOKED FOR YOU by Dan Gribbin.<br />
<br />
Dan Gribbin has put together a collection of well written, intelligent and witty songs that begins by evoking a consciousness about Florida. Using satire as his primary weapon, ''Our Florida Story Will Be Told'' and ''We've Come To Privatize'' bring forth a political and ecological theme early on in the CD.<br />
<br />
Dan then switches gears a bit and addresses the affairs of the heart. He uses humor if only to keep from crying, it seems, in songs like ''Only Marking Time'' and the the title song ''Looked For You''. Likewise the humorous ''Nothin' Doing'' and ''Lickin' My Jelly Knife'' use love-lost themes in a funny and satirical way. It's Dan's world and welcome to it!<br />
<br />
''Morning for Martha'' is downright pretty and showcases Dan's unique vibrato vocals. Although he keeps his tounge firmly in cheek throughout, Dan can get serious and even philosophical as in the songs ''Music Is the Language'' and ''Love Is Gonna Be Our Dance.''<br />
<br />
The final two songs ''Little Piece of Heaven'' and ''Spirit Running Through'' end the CD nicely on a positive note, evoking an image of spirituality and even a little Kum-by-ya-ness.<br />
<br />
The music is well done, although a bit sparse and lean at times. The piano comes in to save several songs and the guitar playing is first rate throughout. The electric 12 string sounds especially nice here.<br />
<br />
It's a good CD and fairly well represents Dan's live performance. Whenever we see Dan play a set, we know we're in for a good laugh and some well written songs.<br />
<br />
Best song on the CD: ''Lickin' My Jelly Knife.''<br />

Some new and different musical experiences are on tap for the next couple of weeks, along with my second opportunity to play at Sorrentos in the Port Orange Plaza.  This weekend, Ill be going upscale (with a fancy tip jar!), playing at an art show in the private home of German friends here in Daytona.  You are all invited to come, listen to the music, enjoy the art.  You may even want to take some homeboth CDs and art work.  Then, after my March 1 date at Sorrentos, Work Release Program will play at the Gaylord Palms Resort in Kissimee on March 7,  at a private party.  Well be featuring Music of the 60s, and its a great show were working up, with music by Peter, Paul & Mary, The Kingston Trio, Crosby Stills & Nash, and others.  So keep us in mind if your organization would like to book a group.  And if you havent yet gotten a copy of Looked for You, see the note below.  Guaranteed good listening. <br />

Thanks to all who came to the concert at Sorrento Pizza and Deli last Saturday evening.  Management was very enthusiastic about the response, I certainly enjoyed entertaining you, and it looked as if you were having a pretty fine time yourselves.  Quite an evening, especially considering that the weather cooperated, even if the weatherman and his female compatriots looked a bit frazzled.  Well do it again on March 1 with fewer tornado warnings.  Hope to see you at the Art Show in Eustis on Saturday or at the bookstore in Ormond soon.    <br />

Early reviews are in, and the new CD Looked for You is proving to be popular with those who have purchased copies.  Thats gratifying news, but I constantly bear in mind that without the audience, there would be no music.  So much of the credit for my continued effort to produce the songs (and to improve the performance) goes to those of you who have provided such wonderful support over these past few years.  Its the best gift I could hope to receive, and I pledge to give my best in return.  On the immediate horizon is the Live at Leu Gardens concert on Sunday.  Martha will be providing the music for our service at the Unitarian church in Ormond, and then well be heading down I-4 to Leu Gardens to get tuned up for the concert.  There is a charge at the door, so well be starting promptly at 2:30 pm to be sure to pack good value into our sojourn onstage as the opening act for David LaMotte.  Well look forward to seeing you there.  (Please reply to this e-mail if you are in need of transportation.)  <br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
--Dec. 30 (Sun)  Dan will be opening at 2:30 pm for David LaMotte in this edition of the Live at Leu Gardens concert series.  (See attached JPEG for details.)  Concert attendees have the run of the grounds for the afternoon, and the grounds are beautiful.  The concert is indoors in the Camilia Room of the big Garden House.  Leu Gardens is located at 1920 N. Forest Ave., Orlando FL 32803.  Map and directions at www.leugardens.org/locate.html or see my website.  Phone: 407-679-6426 or 407-246-2620.<br />

You heard it on WELE, 1380 AM in Ormond Beach!  I survived my first radio studio performance as Chuck Spano and I promoted MusicFest 2007.  This show will take place in the spacious, air-conditioned comfort of our new venue, The Book Store & So Much More in Ormond Beach.  The big event is this Saturday, and if youre coming for the evening concert, it will probably be best to arrive at 6:30 in order to get ticketed and settled into a seat for my 7 pm performance.  But there will be plenty of music earlier in the day, as well, as the lineup below indicates.  The flyer for the event can be accessed at the following URL: <<http://www.floridafolkmusic.org/musicfest2007.htm>>  <br />

Camp Creative UU provided a wonderful chance to work with a dozen young people who took to folk music like ducks to water.  Their animated performance of Little Blue and The Water Turkey at the showcase for parents at the end of the week demonstrated that folk music is certainly alive and well among the live wires in the 4-14 age range.<br />
<br />
The Just Plain Folks Roadtrip Showcase at A Third Place in downtown Eustis, last Tuesday, was one of the most enjoyable evenings of music that I can remember.  It was great to renew acquaintances and to sample such a variety of musical genres.  SusieCool and I seemed to be the only ones working the humorous side of the streetshe did Computer Love and I performed Bad Cholesterol.  The group photo should be a real classic!<br />
<br />
Im busy preparing for the Aug. 3 concert at Infusion Tea in Orlando.  This should be a good chance for Orlando friends to get together in a very attractive setting.  With a couple of new songs to share, Im also preparing some familiar classics like Cat Stevenss Peace Train, a song that has been popular at my peace concerts.  And I thought Pete Seegers salute to advancing age Get Up and Go would be appropriate, though I hope we havent reached the point yet where Rock Around the Clock gives way to The Walk Around the Block.  Please circle Friday the 3rd on your calendar, and Ill look forward to seeing you. <br />
