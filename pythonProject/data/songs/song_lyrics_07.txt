 						Florida's child will race the wind.
 She'll laugh if you try to chase, and then
 She'll lose you among the cypress knees,
 Bowing to great applause from the towering trees.
 
 Florida's child has rainbow eyes
 For tracing her colors on the skies.
 A merry-go-round of clouds now whirls;
 She lies in the grass and smiles as they twirl and twirl.
 
 Bridge:  Florida's child regards the tides
 As rhythm to do her dancing by.
 As gulls glide high above the strand,
 She coaxes a dragonfly with her outstretched hand.
 
 Florida's child regales the moon
 By weaving her beams along the dunes
 As leatherback hatchlings cross the sand.
 She watches them trade the land for the open sea.
