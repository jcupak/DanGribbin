 						PALM TREE FOREST
 
 Our Florida home has four palm trees--
 Up the street, royal palms drop their plump round seeds.
 But an hour from here is an awesome stand
 Of miles of palms growing thick and grand.
 
 The palm tree forest is a magical place.
 It'll lift your spirits, put a smile on your face
 With blue kingfishers and swallowtail kites,
 And a bullfrog chorus that'll croak all night.
 
 When my son was young, we lived far away
 From the Florida sand, but I vowed someday
 To return to the land of the sabal palm,
 Where the herons still fish when the breeze is calm.
 
 The palm tree forest is a magical place.
 It'll lift your spirits, put a smile on your face
 With blue kingfishers and swallowtail kites,
 And a bullfrog chorus that'll croak all night.
 
 Each summer we'd drive, with the school year done,
 To bask for a week in the Florida sun.
 And we cheered as we finally rolled in sight
 Of the palm tree forest that was our delight.
 
 The palm tree forest is a magical place.
 It'll lift your spirits, put a smile on your face
 With blue kingfishers and swallowtail kites,
 And a bullfrog chorus that'll croak all night.
 
 I'm an older man, and I long for the day
 When my son and his wife will arrive for a stay
 With a grandchild or two who will feel and see,
 The spirit of the palms and the forest for the trees.
 
 The palm tree forest is a magical place.
 It'll lift your spirits, put a smile on your face
 With blue kingfishers and swallowtail kites,
 And a bullfrog chorus that'll croak all night.
