 						You can dial it back with the Buddha,
 A lotus blossom floating in your smile.
 You can dial it back with the Buddha.
 Change your pace. Smooth your style.  (Repeat this line.)
 
 You try to sprint, run, jump the gun,
 Convince yourself that you're the one,
 You play the field for short-term tangible gains.
 You wake up in an empty bed,
 A hammer pounds your throbbing head.
 My friend, a dose of self-reflection can neutralize your pain.
 
 And you can dial it back with the Buddha,
 A lotus blossom floating in your smile.
 You can dial it back with the Buddha.
 Change your pace. Smooth your style. (Repeat this line.)
 
 Dial back from high to low, ease the flow,
 There ain't no place you need to go.
 You'll never smell the roses from the fast lane.
 Dial back and walk a mile. Stay a while.
 Resuscitate your inner child.
 That path you've chosen is foreclosin' on the best part of your brain.
 
 But you can dial it back with the Buddha,
 A lotus blossom floating in your smile.
 You can dial it back with the Buddha.
 Change your pace. Smooth your style. (Repeat this line.)

 You gotta park that rocket eighty-eight.
 This ain't no race, there's no ground to make up.
 Let your Buddha percolate,
 You'll love that self you liberate.
 Wake up to peace, wake up.
 
 And you can dial it back with the Buddha,
 A lotus blossom floating in your smile.
 You can dial it back with the Buddha.
 Change your pace. Smooth your style. (Repeat this line.)
