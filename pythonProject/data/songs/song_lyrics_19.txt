 						Rich man, poor man, beggarman thief
 Rise to meet the day.
 Sun shines down on the roof and the leaf.
 Work and sweat and play.
 
 Dance me silly to the rising moon.
 Sing me the setting sun.
 Lost my money but I found my heart.
 Lucky, lucky one.
 
 Grabs him a gold brick, I get a piece.
 Nibble my bread all day.
 Builds him a barn to protect his fleece;
 I smell the new-mown hay.
 
 Dance me silly to the rising moon.
 Sing me the setting sun.
 Lost my money, but I found my heart.
 Lucky, lucky one.
 
 Build me a cabin where the wind don't roar.
 I'll stay a night or two.
 Build me a boat with a silver oar.
 I'll bid those hedgerows adieu.
 
 The river runs high and the river runs low,
 Carving the seasons through.
 The river runs wild with the melting snow;
 I want to run with you.
 
 Dance me silly to the rising moon.
 Sing me the setting sun.
 Lost my money, but I found my heart.
 Lucky, lucky one.  Lucky, lucky one.
 
 I ain't a rich man, you can see,
 Wish't I had a dime.
 Vagabond bird in yonder tree
 Sings to me all the time
 
 Dance me silly to the rising moon.
 Sing me the setting sun.
 Lost my money, but I found my heart.
 Lucky, lucky one.  Lucky, lucky one.  
 Oh, ain't I the lucky . . . one.  Lucky, lucky one.
