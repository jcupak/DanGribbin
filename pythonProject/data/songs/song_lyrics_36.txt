 						LICKIN' MY JELLY KNIFE 
 
 I had me a girl who'd pop your eyes out, watchin' her pass in jeans;
 About once a month we'd fly to Vegas, playin' them slot machines.
 Then one day some rhinestone cowboy crawled from under a rock;
 He whispered things and bought her a ring, and they left me holdin' my socks.
 
 It's hard to believe, but here I am, back leadin' the single life,
 Drinkin' milk straight from the carton and lickin' my jelly knife.
 
 Last summer, I met a gal at the beach in a skimpy yellow thong;
 She could turn a man most inside out, and his tongue'd be draggin' along.
 She told me she thought I'd hung the moon, and who was I to complain,
 Then she found someone else to tie that thong, and the moon broke off its chain.
 
 It's hard to believe, but here I am, back leadin' the single life,
 Drinkin' milk straight from the carton and lickin' my jelly knife.
 
 Yeah, I know the drill, but there ain't much thrill tuckin' myself in nights;
 I'm drinkin' milk straight from the carton and lickin' my jelly knife.
 
 Well, I got me a new companion--she ain't fancy like the rest;
 She ain't even sure if she likes my style, and I'm willin' to flunk that test.
 'Cause she's willin' to pay a full month's rent and buy her own T-bones;
 We met at a local honkytonk, I only walked her halfway home.
 
 She tells me it's all the same to her if she never becomes my wife;
 She drinks her milk straight from the carton and she licks her jelly knife.
 Some nights she stays, some nights she goes, but I'm bettin' it turns out right:
 We're drinkin' milk straight from the carton, and lickin' our jelly,
      lickin' our jelly, lickin' our jelly knife.
