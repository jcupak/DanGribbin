 						1. Seems to me if we dance together,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 Burden's gonna feel light as a feather,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.
 
 Seems to me if we sing in chorus,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 Trouble's gonna fall down, make way for us,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.
 
 Life is gonna be our . . . Love is gonna be our . . . Life is gonna be our dance.
 Love is gonna be our . . . Life is gonna be our . . . Love is gonna be our dance;
 
 2. When we dance together in a circle,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 We show the war man his plan just won't work, oh,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.
 
 When we dance up to that wall of hatred,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 We show the world that life and love are sacred,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.                         [Chorus]
 
 3. In the morning, sing our psalm at sunrise,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 We feel the love that rains down from the blue skies,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.
 
 In the evening, sunset paints her colors,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 We sing a song of peace for us and others,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.                         [Chorus]
 
 4. We know the world is full of folks who love peace,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 We pray the guns below and the bombs above cease,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.
 
 And when we dance together with our neighbor,
 	Love is gonna be our dance,
 We show the cause of peace can never waver,
 	Love is gonna be our dance.                         [Chorus]
