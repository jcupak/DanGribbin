 						THERE'LL COME A TIME                      
 
 There'll come a time, when the folks who are going hungry will be fed.
 When the stones that block our path will turn to bread.
 Oh, the songs that we will sing, the harvest we will bring,
 There'll come a time, don't you know, there'll come a time.
 
 There'll come a time, when the children will find shelter from the cold.
 The pariah will be welcomed to the fold.
 A new circle will be drawn, voices raised in grateful song,
 There'll come a time, oh, don't you know, there'll come a time.
 
 There'll come a time, when the heart will be our touchstone.
 When the graceful dove will soar in peaceful flight.
 There'll come a time, when the hand once raised in anger,
 Will rock the cradle through the stormy night.
 
 There'll come a time, when the wounds of our planet will be healed.
 When the creatures of the forest and the field
 Will multiply and thrive, what a time to be alive.
 There'll come a time, don't you know, there'll come a time.
 
 Oh, the hungry will be fed, and the children tucked in bed;
 The world's artillery will rust in memory;
 And the silent battlefield to a thousand songbirds yield,
 There'll come a time . . don't you know . . . . . there'll come a time.
