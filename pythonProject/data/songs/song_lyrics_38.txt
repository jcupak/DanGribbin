 						THE DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST		
 
 Run with me--the devil take the hindmost;
 Chase me through the high grass.
 One, two, three--duck around a fencepost;
 I'm too fast.
 
 Chase me down in the hollow where the sweet doe
 Leans to drink from the branch.
 Chase me up in the meadow where the fox goes;
 Spin me there in a trance.
 
 Run with me--the devil take the hindmost;
 Race around you all day.
 Plunge with me, tumble like a stream flows
 Hear me laugh at such play.
 
 Who could find us, up along the ridge line,
 Reach me up to the sun?
 Far behind us, down among the scrub pines,
 Work gets done. . . .  Oh, it always gets done, done, done.
 
 They run to work.
 They run up stairs,
 To pay their bills,
 To earn their cares.
 
 Run with me--the devil take the hindmost;
 Race around you all day.
 Plunge with me, tumble like a stream flows
 Hear me laugh at such play.
 
 Chase me down in the hollow where the sweet doe
 Leans to drink from the branch.
 Chase me up in the meadow where the fox goes;
 Spin me there in a trance.
 
 Run with me--the devil take the hindmost;
 Chase me through the high grass.
 One, two, three--duck around a fencepost;
 I'm too fast. . . .  You know I'm too fast, fast, fast.
 
 If you should catch me,
 Won't you land me soft
 On a lilac bed
 With my hat thrown off.
 
 Run with me--the devil take the hindmost;
 Race around you all day.
 Plunge with me, tumble like a stream flows
 Hear me laugh at such play.
 
 Chase me down in the hollow where the sweet doe
 Leans to drink from the branch.
 Chase me up in the meadow where the fox goes;
 Spin me there in a trance.
 
 Run with me--the devil take the hindmost;
 Chase me through the high grass.
 One, two, three--duck around a fencepost;
 I'm too fast. 
 
 I can guarantee that you won't catch me,
 'Cause I'm too fast.
