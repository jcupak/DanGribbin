 						WE'RE SAND HILL CRANES
 
 We're sandhill cranes, with half-filled brains;
 I'm a flighty kind of guy, and she's a ditsy dame.
 We refused to study and our moms were peeved;
 When we found each other we were so relieved.
 
 We're two birds of a feather; we're identical types.
 On our heads in red are identical stripes.
 We're sandhill cranes with half-filled brains.
 And we don't mind a bit if we're called half-wit.
 
 Like all cranes worldwide, on our wings we glide;
 Our brains we depend just as little as we can.
 And our diet is strange; through the fields we range,
 Caterpillar is preferred, though we will eat grains.
 
 	Though we mate for life, there's considerable strife;
 	You'll have ruffled pin feathers with a crane for a wife.
 	We're sandhill cranes, with half-filled brains;
 	Anything we learn dribbles down the drain.
 
 We are four feet high, with bright yellow eye;
 We could peck your neck if you happened by.
 But we're not that sort; we're just good sports,
 Though we don't like coot 'cause they're too darn short.
 
 In our mating dance, we will jump and prance,
 Then we'll bow to each other; what a sound we will utter.
 We're sandhill cranes, with half-filled brains,
 And we stay outdoors even when it rains.
