 						There's a dream that comes to me, 
 constant as the tides.
 A little girl comes running, 
 her arms extended wide.
 She tells me she can fly, now, 
 like the birds her feeder drew.
 She tells me she's no longer sick.  
 She tells me skies are blue.
 
 Erin at the window 
 named the birds she loved.
 The cardinal she called Redboy, 
 and then came Lady Dove.
 Sir Nuthatch, feeding upsidedown, 
 her favorite she declared.
 And though her voice grew weak, 
 I think, the birds knew she was there.
 
 Erin was my only child, 
 and I a single dad
 Tried to fill her every day 
 with everything I had.
 Now I rise at dawn to greet 
 her birds as they arrive.
 Filling Erin's feeders 
 might be keeping me alive.
 
 Erin at the window 
 named the birds she loved.
 The cardinal she called Redboy, 
 and then came Lady Dove.
 Sir Nuthatch, feeding upsidedown, 
 her favorite she declared.
 And though her voice grew weak,
  I think the birds knew she was there.
 
 I don't pretend to understand 
 why little girls should die.
 My world is a kaleidoscope 
 of memories and sighs.
 
 Sir Nuthatch entertains me, now; 
 Redboy bids me cheer.
 Lady Dove's more sombre note 
 pervades the atmosphere.
 These little creatures never failed 
 to conjure Erin's smile.
 I feed them with the hands that held 
 my precious, precious child.
 
 Erin at the window 
 named the birds she loved.
 The cardinal she called Redboy, 
 and then came Lady Dove.
 Sir Nuthatch feeding upsidedown 
 defuses my despair.
 And glancing at the window, I know Erin, 
 my sweet Erin, is watching there.
