 						When we've got little left to lose, I'll sing you love.
 Doing battle with the blues, I'll sing you love.
 Sing to lift us past the pain, beyond excuse and blame.
 Ever mindful of our truths, I'll sing you love.
 	Sing you love, I'll sing you love.  All the livelong day.
 
 And when we scrape to pay the rent, you sing me love.
 With our bottom dollar spent, you sing me love.
 We walk the rocky path, hand in hand and laugh in laugh.
 With a voice that's heaven-sent, you sing me love.
 	Sing me love, you sing me love.  All the livelong day.
 
 Love is gentle, love is kind, conquers all and yet is blind,
 	Offer ties that freely bind.
 
 In a world where nothing's sure, yet we know love.
 Darkest night, pitch-black, but we're aglow with love.
 Called by instincts of the heart, compassion to impart.
 Count us happy, rich or poor, as we show love.
 	As we show love, as, we show love.  All the livelong day.
 
 And when we've stood to face the dare, though we wish we could be spared,
 	Just remember I'll be there . . . to sing you love.
 
 When we've got little left to lose, I'll sing you love.
 Doing battle with the blues, I'll sing you love.
 And we'll walk the rocky path, hand in hand and laugh in laugh.
 Ever mindful of our truths, I'll sing you love.
 	Sing you love, I'll sing you love.  All the livelong day.
