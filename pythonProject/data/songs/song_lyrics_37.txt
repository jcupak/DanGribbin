 						THE MOON AND A FEW HIGH CLOUDS		
 
 Dreaming of you at sunset.
 Watching a few high clouds.
 A seagull or two,
 The moon rises blue.
 I whisper your name out loud.
 
 Thanking you for the postcard.
 Beautiful view of Rome.
 You write: "Wish you were here,
 My charioteer.
 Hello to the folks back home."
 
 I know they sent you over there to lose me.
 I know you said the time would hasten by.
 I know these witty postcards should amuse me.
 But how I wish that homeward bird would fly.
 
 You're due to land next Sunday.
 Holding my breath 'til then.
 Toward that rendezvous
 The moon and a few
 High clouds and a kiss I send . . . to you.
