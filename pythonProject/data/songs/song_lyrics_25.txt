 						SPIRIT RUNNING THROUGH
 
 I feel that spirit running through;
 It runs through me, it runs through you.
 And when I breathe that ocean air,
 I know that spirit?s everywhere?it?s everywhere.
 
 I see a dolphin in the waves;
 He wants to know how much I gave
 To make his world a better place
 For dolphinkind and the human race?the human race.
 
 I see a girl I used to know,
 And in her eyes I see that glow;
 And I?m reminded once again
 How wide our circle can extend?it can extend.
 
 I feel that spirit running through;
 It runs through me, it runs through you.
 And when I breathe that ocean air,
 I know that spirit?s everywhere?it?s everywhere.
 
 We know it?s love that brings us through;
 A loving gesture rings so true.
 And when we lend a helping hand,
 Our love will flow throughout the land?throughout the land.
 
 I feel that spirit running through;
 It runs through me, it runs through you.
 And when I breathe that ocean air,
 I know that spirit?s everywhere?it?s everywhere,
 It?s everywhere.  It?s everywhere.
