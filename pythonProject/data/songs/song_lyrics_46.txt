 						Are you mindful of a message on the wind?
 It will tell you of the world you're flowing in.
 If you listen, you will hear a mother's sigh,
 Feel the wingbeats of a passing butterfly.
 
 Are you mindful of the rhythms of your day?
 Are you tuned to subtle dances on your way?
 Where the brook pools, there's a swish of sudden fins.
 On the breeze falls a cascade of petals thin.
 
 Are you mindful that the moment is for you?
 Leave behind you the million things to do.
 Your delight in watching skimmer chicks grow strong
 Invests you on that beach where you belong.
 
 Are you mindful of compassion you can show?
 Will you hear me if I whisper something low?
 Are you mindful of the message on the wind?
 Can you feel it, now, that wave you're flowing in?
 
 Are you mindful? Are you mindful? Are you mindful?
