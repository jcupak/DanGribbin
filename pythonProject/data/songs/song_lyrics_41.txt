 						9 WOOD STORKS	        
 
 Nine wood storks in the same tall tree;
 Who's gonna sleep a wink?  Not me.
 I'm number ten, and I'm tellin' you now,
 Nine wood storks make a terrible row.
 Never sleep a wink 'cause they bicker all night.
 Wood storks thinkin' they gotta be right.
 Roost all night in a very tall tree.
 Nine wood storks gonna chatter round me.
 
 Clack-a-little-beak-a-little wood stork song;
 Wood storks bickerin' all night long.
 Clack-a-little-beak and would a wood stork snooze?  [Uh-nhn.]
 So I'm standin' here singin' these wood stork blues.
 
 Wood stork spends his day in the flats
 Lookin' for food wherever it's at.
 Wood stork's food comin' slow down the chain;
 Then comes a cloud, and it looks like rain.
 Wood stork optimism don't come easy.
 Siftin' through the mud makes you feel a little queasy.
 Roost all night in a very tall tree.
 Nine wood storks gonna chatter round me.
 
 Clack-a-little-beak-a-little wood stork song;
 Wood storks bickerin' all night long.
 Clack-a-little-beak and would a wood stork snooze? [Uh-nhn.]
 So I'm standin' here singin' these wood stork blues.
 
 Nine wood storks in the same tall tree;
 Who's gonna sleep a wink?  Not me.
 I'm number ten, and I'm tellin' you now,
 Nine wood storks make a terrible row.
 Never sleep a wink 'cause they bicker all night.
 Wood storks thinkin' they gotta be right.
 I'm the exception, of course, you know
 Somebody's gotta be perfect, so. [Uh-nhn.]
