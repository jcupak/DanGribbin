 						My Louisiana heron's got a musical ear.
 He loves the Cajun accordian of Clifton Chenier.
 He thinks Buckwheat Zydeco plays a good tune.
 Oughta see him catchin' shrimp beneath the Louisiana Moon.
 
 Louisi-, Lousi-, Lousiana heron; he's a bluesy, bluesy, bluesy little heron.
 Okra gumbo is his go-to treat.
 Yeah, he cracks his crawfish to a Cajun beat.
 
 My Louisiana heron's got a ear for the blues.
 He bought a B. B. King record but he wore out the grooves.
 He knows T-bone Walker is a guitar whiz.
 But my Louisiana heron's got a beat that's all his.
 
 Louisi-, Lousi-, Lousiana heron; he's a bluesy, bluesy, bluesy little heron.
 Loves his music and he loves to sing    
 Down in Pirates' Alley where the church bells ring.
 
 I saw my Louisiana heron down on Tchoupitoulas St.
 Yeah, a French Quarter bird loves a lively jazz beat.
 But when Dr. John is playing funky and slow,
 My Louisiana heron be a-tappin' his toe.
 
 Louisi-, Lousi-, Lousiana heron; he's a bluesy, bluesy, bluesy little heron.
 Loves his music and he loves to sing    
 Down in Jackson Square where the church bells ring.
 
 Now my Louisiana heron loves a trolley car ride.
 Goin' up St. Charles on the levee side.
 He grabs a uptown snack at Camellia Grill.
 Then it's back on the trolley when he's had his fill.
 
 Louisi-, Lousi-, Lousiana heron; bluesy, bluesy, bluesy little heron.
 Up to Pat O'Brien's for a hurricane.
 Yeah, you just might see him dancin' in the rain.
 
 Louisi-, Lousi-, Lousiana heron; bluesy, bluesy, bluesy little heron.
 Okra gumbo is his go-to treat.
 He cracks his crawfish to a Cajun beat.
