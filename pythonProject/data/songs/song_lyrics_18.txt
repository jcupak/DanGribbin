 						Gumdrop delight and peppermint roses,
 Butterscotch tea at two.
 Dragonflies might, but no one supposes
 I've got a thing about you.
 
 You book a flight on Flutterby Airline,
 I hop a freight or two.
 Wouldn't you know we'd hook up to share time
 Deep in the tumbling blue.
 
 You tell me dancing is your delight.
 I have to admit I'd prefer a hike.
 You know all the steps at the French ballet.
 I kick off my shoes in the small cafe.
 
 We laught til dawn in the Pecan Pagoda,
 Sipping a very pale brew.
 You disappear as we quaff our quota,
 Trusting my heart to pursue.
 
 Gumdrop delight and peppermint roses,
 Butterscotch tea at two.
 Dragonflies might, but no one supposes
 I've got a thing about you.
