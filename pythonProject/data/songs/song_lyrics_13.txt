 						There's a state I'm in I know you'll recognize if you have ever
 Driven south and just kept rollin' all day long.
 No one on earth could qualify to love this state as much as I,
 But you could cast yourself adrift and come along.
 
 Cypress trees dot these swamps that I love.
 Ocean breeze, I spot pelicans above.
 Take your mountains, take your plains, take your craggy coast of Maine.  Brrrr.
 You'll find me dodging hurricanes in Florida.
 
 Now, if an alligator panics you, you'd best remain up north,
 And don't forget that sharks patrol most every beach.
 But if your tendency's to be a little crazy just like me,
 With luck, then, Florida's the state, my friend, you'll reach.
 
 Cypress trees dot these swamps that I love.
 Ocean breeze, I spot pelicans above.
 Take your mountains, take your plains, take your amber waves of grain.
 	That's right, Todo, you and Dorothy have landed back in Kansas again.
 Me?  I'm down here dodging hurricanes in Florida.
 
 Bridge:  Now you might think I'm speaking totally in jest
 'Bout the dangers rampant in my Sunshine State.
 But I must caution you to take this simple test:
 Red and yellow, friend to fellow.  Red and black, foe to Jack?
 Or is it the other way around?  
 These poisonous snakes can be so very confusing, Mack.
 You say you're gonna make tracks to hightail it back to Hackensack?
 Hackensack, New Jersey?  Was it something I said?
 
 Cypress trees dot these swamps that I love.
 Ocean breeze, I spot pelicans above.
 Take your mountains, take your plains, take your New York subway trains. 
     God bless you Bob Dylan, with your Tambourineman-blue subterranean brain. 
 I'm happy dodging hurricanes in Florida.
