A FRIEND LIKE YOU 
© 2016 by Daniel V. Gribbin
 
You ask me what a friendship means and how I know it's true,
I just shake my head in wonder . . . what a spell of luck I'm under . . .
To have found . . . a friend like you. 

[chorus]
A friend's a jack when your tire's gone flat.
A friend's an outstretched hand when your hammock flips
And you're lying on your back.
A friend's a cold drink when your well runs dry.
A friend's a ride back home when you've lost your keys and you need an alibi.  
 
[Repeat chorus]
 
A friend's a rope when you're stuck in mud.
A friend's a dozen jelly doughnuts when your cake falls with a thud.
A friend's a grace note when you're out of tune.
A friend's a hundred-dollar bailout from that jail in Lost Lagoon.
 
[Repeat chorus]
 
[Bridge]
Who wrote the book on friendship?  I suspect you did.
And when the chips are down and the die is cast,
You'll have my back . . . like the Sundance Kid.         
 
A friend's a word when you're out of line.
A friend's a glance that says "unplug it" with your tendency to whine.
A friend's a phone call when your world looks bleak.
An extra paddle when it's obvious you're stranded up a creek.
 
You ask me what a friendship means and how I know it's true,
I just shake my head in wonder . . . what a spell of luck I'm under . . .
To have found . . . a friend like you.
