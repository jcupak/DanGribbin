Time approximate--will verify closer to actual date.

Martha Brandt and I will be giving a joint concert in the Littner Concert series at UU Ormond.  Martha will play for half an hour, then we'll join forces for half an hour, and then I will go solo for the final half hour.
Directions:
56 N. Halifax is one block north of Granada on the beachside.  Coming from the west, cross the river on Granada and turn left at the second light, which is Halifax.  Look for the church on the left, a one-story beige building.
Other:
There will be sandwiches and drinks available.
