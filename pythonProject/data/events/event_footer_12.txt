Traveling south on US1 (Ridgewood Ave.), turn left onto 10th Street.  Daytona Ave. is three blocks  from this intersection.  Turn left on Daytona Ave. and go until you see an opportunity to turn into a parking lot prior to the construction area.  This is Sica Hall.  There is more parking in the back, toward the right of the hall.  If coming from Riverside Dr., turn west onto 10th St. and then turn right onto Daytona Ave.
