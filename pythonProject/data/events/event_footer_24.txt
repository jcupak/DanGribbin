Press:
I'll be the first of four members of the Fingerstyle Guitar group to play.  We'll each play for 20 minutes or so.  It's a very congenial group that meets once a month to share our music, and this concert will be an informal opportunity for us to share with a wider audience.
Directions:
Coming from Rollins College direction, turn right on Park Ave. at Lyman Ave. and drive almost to the end of Lyman, where you will turn in to the library parking lot just before you arrive at Aloma.  There are signs for the turn to the library if you are coming in on Aloma or approaching from the Fairbanks Ave. side.
