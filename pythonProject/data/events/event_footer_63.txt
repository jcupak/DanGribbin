Press:
I do a mix of original music and old folk favorites such as "City of New Orleans."  This is where I try out new material, so the phrase "you heard it here first" actually does apply.
Directions:
Sorrento's is in the Port Orange Plaza, the little shopping center on the southwest corner of the intersection of US1 and Dunlawton.  The shopping center is in an L shape, and the restaurant is in the corner of the right angle, flanked by the video store on the one side and the barber shop on the other side.  It is a very welcoming family-style restaurant with great food.
