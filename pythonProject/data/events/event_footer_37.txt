Press:
I'll be performing from 7-9:30 for this Thursday evening gig at Olivia's.  I'll also have available by "Shore Birds in the Surf" note cards based on the exhibit now on display at the Unitarian Universalist Society gallery in Ormond Beach (56 N. Halifax).
Directions:
Eustis is 30 miles west of DeLand on Rt. 44.  Olivia's in right downtown on Bay St.  Approaching from DeLand, go right at the stoplight at Grove St. and then go left after two blocks.  Bay St. will be the stoplight you reach before driving into the lake.  : )  Take a left, since it's a one-way street.
