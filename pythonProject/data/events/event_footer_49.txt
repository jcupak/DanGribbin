Press:
I will play for Sunday brunch, beginning at about 11:30, with a mix or original songs and familiar cover tunes from James Taylor, Cat Stevens, Leonard Cohen, Buddy Holly, The Kingston Trio, and many others.

Cuvee is a beautiful wine bar and tapas restaurant with a very comfortable ambiance.
Directions:
Cuvee is on the south side of Granada, not quite as far east as A1A.  The turn off Granada is marked by a very visible sign.  For additional parking behind the restaurant, take a left at the stop sign at the back of Cuvee's lot and then turn right into the huge lot with numbered spaces.
