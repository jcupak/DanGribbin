Work Release Program will entertain from 3-5 pm on Saturday, Jan. 26, at the Gazebo in Ferran Park during the Eustis Art Show.  We'll be doing some individual numbers as well as our trio singing
Directions:
Eustis is 30 miles west of DeLand on Rt. 44.  In effect, Rt. 44 deadends into the lakefront park where we'll be playing, but it might be best to turn north onto Rt. 19 (Grove St.) at the stoplight and then drive a few blocks and turn left to go down to the lakefront .
