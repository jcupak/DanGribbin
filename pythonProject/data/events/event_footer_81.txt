Press:
I'll be playing for the celebration of The Loop's designation as a Florida Scenic Highway.  There's a free picnic lunch, and the music will begin at 11 am and run through 2 pm.  I'll be playing either 11-12 or 1-2, from what I've been told.  Lots of activities, and the state park fee will be waived for the day, so come on out.
Directions:
Beach St. begins at Granada running north from the bridge on the mainland side of the river.  Go out Beach St. north until you see the big sign for Tomoka State Park.  Turn right and drive straight back to the area near the restaurant along the river.
