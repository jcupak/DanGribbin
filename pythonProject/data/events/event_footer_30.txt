Press:
On Saturday, March 12, I will be performing on the Azalea Stage at 10:30 a.m. for half an hour.  

By then, I will have been up for five hours, having shot about 300 photos of birds on the nearby lake at dawn, weather permitting.

The campground is northwest of Dade City out County Road 41, and there are signs marking the turn north off of that road.  The campground lies just east of I-75.
Other:
Lots of great musicians and good food at the vendors' booths.  I'll be camping, and so can you!
