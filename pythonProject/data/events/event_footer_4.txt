Press:
I'll be playing for both dinner sittings, the first at 6 pm and the second at 8 pm.  Please make reservations for one or the other of the two sittings, since seating is limited.  Call Donna at 386-290-9464.
Directions:
Going north on U.S. 1 (Yonge St.), just beyond Southern Paint and a kitchen outfitter, on the right, is Mia dona Market, a couple of blocks prior to reaching Granada.  There's a nice sign, out front, but it's just a driveway, so look carefully to make your turn off US1.  Parking is behind the building.
