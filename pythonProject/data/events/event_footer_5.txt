I'll be playing a mixture of original and cover tunes from 6-8 pm, and I'll be happy to take requests.  Special feature:  My shore bird note cards will be on display.  Arrive during the first hour and receive one free card.  Discounts on purchases of boxes of cards.
Directions:
Ormond, Daytona or New Smyrna:  Go south on Tomoka Farms Rd. (Rt. 415) past the Deltona turn at Howland Rd. and past Skip's, begin looking for the diner, which bears the number 195.  Dollar General is on the right; you turn left into the Osteen Diner.  It's about 20 minutes south of Rt. 44 on Rt. 415.

From Orlando or from the Space Coast area:  Your goal is the intersection of Rt. 46 and Rt. 415 in Sanford, just east of the airport.  So if you're coming on I-4, take the Rt. 46 exit and go east to 415.  From I-95, go west on Rt.  46 to 415.  In either case, you will go north on 415 until your reach Osteen.  Look for the Osteen Diner on the right side of the road--big sign.
