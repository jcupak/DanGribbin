Sorrento's is in the Port Orange Plaza, the little shopping center on the southwest corner of the intersection of US1 and Dunlawton.  The shopping center is in an L shape, and the restaurant is in the corner of the right angle, flanked by the video store on the one side and the barber shop on the other side.  It is a very welcoming place under new management with a fabulous cook.
