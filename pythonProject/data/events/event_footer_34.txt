Dan will present an evening of song entitled "A Touch of Musical Magic," combining his original music with singalong opportunities--folk favorites by James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Tom Paxton, Paul Simon, Pete Seeger and others.  The theme of the evening will be the wonderful effects on our soul and on our community of shared creativity.  Bring your instrument, bring your voice, bring your creative self.
