Press:
I will be playing from 7-9:30 pm a selection of original tunes and folk & blues favorites.  Requests always welcome.
Directions:
Rt. 44 coming from the east intersects Rt. 19 at the traffic light at Orange Ave.  Go right onto Orange and go up a few blocks, taking a left at the post office.  Go a block or so toward the traffic light and park in one of the lots on the left.  Walk up to Bay St. (the busy thoroughfare toward the lake) and find Olivia's in the middle of the block on the east side of the street, just shy of the theater.
