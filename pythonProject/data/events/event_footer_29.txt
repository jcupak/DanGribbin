Press:
On Sunday, March 13, I will be performing on the Magnolia Stage (in the main pavilion)  at 10:30 a.m. for half an hour.  

By then, I will, once again, have been up for five hours, having shot another 300 photos of birds on the nearby lake at dawn, weather permitting.
Directions:
The campground is northwest of Dade City out County Road 41, and there are signs marking the turn north off of that road.  The campground lies just east of I-75.
Other:
Lots of great musicians and good food at the vendors' booths.  I'll be camping, and so can you!
