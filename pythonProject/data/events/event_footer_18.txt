The campground is northwest of Dade City out County Road 41, and there are signs marking the turn north off of that road.  The campground lies just east of I-75.
Other:
I'll be camping during the weekend, rising at dawn to shoot photos of birds in the marsh near the campground.  Then it's on with the guitar and a day of music.  Hope to see you there!
