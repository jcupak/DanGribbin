 						LOOKED FOR YOU
 
 Verse 1:
 
 Looked for you across the water, where the heron softly glides;
 Landing there among the cat-tails, where he fished the other side.
 As I looked for you, I wondered, how the heron mourns his mate.
 Does he see her in reflection, as the ripples undulate?
 
   Chorus:
 
 One day, you said:  "Life is fragile;
 What we value sometimes breaks.
 Mother Nature never reckons
 What she gives and what she takes."
 
   Verse 2:
 
 Yes, I wonder how the heron
 Reconciles himself to loss.
 As he stands there in shadows,
 Draped in ancient Spanish moss. 
 
 Does his wisdom teach him courage?
 Does he hold the pain inside?
 Is he feeling lost and hopeless
 At the gift that's now denied?
 
   Chorus:
 
 One day, you said:  "Life is fragile;
 What we value sometimes breaks.
 Mother Nature never reckons
 What she gives and what she takes."
 
   Verse 3:
 
 Looked for you tonight at sunset; found you there among the stars.
 On this shoreline, looking skyward, grateful love can reach so far.
 Still I wonder how the heron reconciles himself to loss.
 As he stands there in reflection, eyeing me from far across.
 
   Chorus:
 
 One day, you said:  "Life is fragile;
 What we value sometimes breaks.
 Mother Nature never reckons
 What she gives and what she takes."
