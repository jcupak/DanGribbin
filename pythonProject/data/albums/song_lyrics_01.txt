LOVE'S THE GIFT WE BRING		
Copyright © 2019 by Daniel V. Gribbin
 
There's a rift that sometimes forms between the world and me.
Join me, though, and we can sing our way toward harmony.
Blended voices rise in song, discord falls away.
An anthem full to help us pull together day by day.
 
Random acts of kindness will show what we're about.
Let's be the ones who speak up to include the ones left out.
Compassion and acceptance strike sympathetic strings.
Love's the heart of harmony, and love's the gift we bring, yes, love's the gift we bring.
 
On occasion you'll encounter someone in distress.
Stoop to lend assistance and your kindness will be blessed.
A gesture of compassion beyond your comfort zone
Will sure be met with gratitude to match the love you've shown.
 
Random acts of kindness will show what we're about.
Let's be the ones who speak up to include the ones left out.
Compassion and acceptance strike sympathetic strings.
Love's the heart of harmony, and love's the gift we bring, yes, love's the gift we bring.
 
You've probably concluded that I'm hopelessly naïve.
But love pays compound interest, when we give, yes, we receive.
 
Squirming in our seats, my friends, might be a healthy sign.
Love's a lesson to be learned; there's no assembly line.
The skylark shares her joy at sunrise; let your voice unfurl.
When love is in the air, yes, it's the song heard round the world.
 
Those random acts of kindness will show what we're about.
Let's be the ones who speak up to include the ones left out.
Compassion and acceptance strike sympathetic strings.
Love's the heart of harmony, and love's the gift we bring, yes, love's the gift we bring.
