 						You want to write a Florida folk song?
 Let me share these simple rules.
 Every craftsman has his strategy,
 Each artisan her tools.
 
 First you grab a good disaster.
 A sinkhole should suffice.
 Then you rile an alligator,
 Just to add some spice.
 
 For you see we live in Florida
 Where trouble lurks in swamps.
 And unsuspecting victims 
 Disappear with chomp, chomp, chomp.
 
 We're writing folk music in Florida
 Where hurricanes abound.
 And whole resorts of suntanned visitors
 Get swallowed by the ground.
 We're blessed with sharkbites in New Smyrna,
 Squishy pythons in the glades.
 A ten-foot crocodile with GPS
 Who'll stalk you wearing shades.
 
 Oh, we could write a dozen ballads
 On the fate of those who swim
 In snake-infested waters--
 The statistics there are grim.
 
 And how about the lightning strikes
 In Tampa where they say
 A waterspout engulfed a town
 That's missing to this day.
 
 Every character in your folk song
 Can meet a gruesome fate
 In this glorious vacationland
 We call the Sunshine State.
 
 
 You see, then, songwriting in Florida
 Is really no great trick.
 Disaster's in the air--
 The sea the land, just take your pick.
 
 I haven't even mentioned
 Coral snakes or large black bears.
 Spiders?  Big as saucers.
 But no use splitting hairs.
 
 Suffice it to remind you,
 My would-be balladeer,
 We're living in a paradise
 Of venom, gore, and fear.
 
 We're writing folk music in Florida
 Where hurricanes abound.
 And whole resorts of suntanned visitors
 Get swallowed by the ground.
 We're blessed with sharkbites in New Smyrna,
 Squishy pythons in the glades.
 A ten-foot crocodile with GPS
 Who'll stalk you wearing shades.
