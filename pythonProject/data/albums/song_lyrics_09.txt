 						I love this place; the Mediterranée is blue.
 I've found a space along the beach to be with you.
 I love this food; I'll have another crème brulée,
 And we can stroll away the evening on
 The Promenade des Anglais.
 
 I'm in the south of France, I'm on the côte d'azur,
 I'm in a painting by Matisse.
 Taking tea at the Negresco,
 On the Promenade at Nice.
 
 I love these trains--the TGV the PLM;
 I love to ride along the coast to look at them,
 Those French girls with their skimpy little yellow thongs;
 A little rendezvous, a little parlez-vous,
 And I'm right where I belong.
 
 I'm in the south of France, I'm on the côte d'azur,
 I'm in a painting by Matisse.
 Taking tea at the Negresco,
 On the Promenade at Nice.
 
 And in the evening, I love to see that tri-couleur,
 That great French flag they fly above the dome's grandeur
 I don't salute, but I sure thank my lucky stars
 That I could live to see a bowl of ratatouille
 And share it right here where you are.
 
 I'm in the south of France, I'm on the côte d'azur,
 I'm in a painting by Matisse.
 Taking tea at the Negresco,
 On the Promenade at Nice.
 
 And if I never see the bridge at Giverny,
 It won't disturb my inner peace;
 I've taken tea at the Negresco
 On the Promenade at Nice.
