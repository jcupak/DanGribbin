 						YOU'LL COME			
 
 Stumbling down a crooked trail, I came upon a lake.
 Your schooner sailing blithely past, you did a doubletake.
 You told me . . .  when I'd lose my path,
 Spirits fading fast, 
 Sailing at half-mast, . . . you'd come.  
 
 There were times I'd think of you, wondering where you sailed.
 In my secret voice I called . . . and you never failed.
 When my troubles grew,
 Couldn't see things through,
 Right out of the blue . . . you'd come. (Repeat these three lines.)
 
 You swooped in like an eagle; you courted your white swan.
 Then a distant thunder . . . called and you were gone.  
 
 Now I'm blessed with souvenirs, bittersweet but kind.
 Withered leaves of memory . . . fall and I don't mind.
 Letters that you'd send
 Reached me now and then.
 Still, I wonder when . . . you'll come.  
 
 Letters that you'd send
 Reached me now and then.
 Still, I wonder when . . . you'll come.
