 						THE IBIS		
 
 The ibis is a humpbacked bird, intent upon the ground.
 You don?t catch them grubs and insects unless you?re looking down.
 But don?t be fooled, the ibis knows the beauties of the sky;
 He just likes to get his work done?he?s a lunchpail kind of guy.
 
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	I wonder how he?d describe us.
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	He?s a funny kind of bird.
 
 Now, if you see an ibis, he?ll be grubbing with some others:
 Gregariously flanking him, some sisters and some brothers.
 It?s true a lone-wolf ibis will occasionally emerge;
 But given half a chance, that solo ibis will converge.
 
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	I wonder how he?d describe us.
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	He?s a funny kind of bird.
 
 The ibis is a midsized bird, quite smaller than a heron.
 But don?t hint he doesn?t measure up?insults he will not bear ?em.
 He walks with funny, halting gait, not unlike an Egyptian.
 His beak?s curved like a boomerang, but I wouldn?t try to pitch him.
 
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	I wonder how he?d describe us.
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	He?s a funny kind of bird.
 
 In color, ibis come in white, unless they?re immature ones,
 In which case look for dusky gray,oh, there are some more obscure ones.
 But what I?d recommend if you would like to know an ibis:
 Just peck along the ground with him to overcome his shyness.
 
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	I wonder how he?d describe us.
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	He?s a funny kind of bird.
 
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	I wonder how he?d describe us.
 	Oh, the ibis,
 	He?s a funny kind of midsized, humpbacked, fascinating bird?the ibis.
