FLORIDA IN MY SOUL
Copyright © 2019 by Daniel V. Gribbin

I've got a great blue heron on a hollow log.
He orders fish for breakfast, with a side of frog.
I've got Florida in my soul.
I've got a pink flamingo on my neighbor's lawn.
She never did move much, but now today she's gone.
I've got Florida in my soul.
 
Chorus:  I've got Florida in my soul.
And there's a creepy crawlin' critter that's a-nibbling at my toe.
I'm gonna grab my guitar and hit the road.
And if an alligator proves to be an instigator when I try to navigate
   around her path . . . I'm gonna biff her in the nose.
 
I've got an Okeechobee Alafaya dream.
I'm gonna sleep till dark and watch the swamp gas gleam.
I've got Florida in my soul.
I've got the northbound leaving on the Seabord Line,
But I'm a southbound drifter in this state of mind.
I've got Florida in my soul.  
 
[Repeat chorus]
 
Bridge:  When you've got Florida in your soul,
You love to hear the bellow of the old bull gator and feel that ocean roll.
 
I've got a snowy egret on a cypress knee.
He lets me take his picture for a nominal fee.
I've got Florida in my soul.
I've got blue crab boiling on an open fire,
And there's a St. Johns monkey on the telephone wire.
I've got Florida in my soul.  
 
[Repeat chorus]
 
I've got a pileated pecker on a sabal palm.
If he's an ivory bill, we call the Audubon.
I've got Florida in my soul.
I'm an endangered species.
I'm the Crocodile Man.
I've got a dozen rattlers eatin' out of my hand.
I've got Florida in my soul.  
 
[Repeat chorus]
