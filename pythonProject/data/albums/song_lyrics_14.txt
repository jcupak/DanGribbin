 						Oleander morning, the dew covers all.
 Seagulls are screaming, "It's time."
 I'd be there to wake you, but duty called.
 Florida is on my mind.
 
 I can hear you talking to Miss Blue,
 Your great blue heron stands tall.
 Miles of beach you're walking, shells a few.
 The fiddler crab commences to crawl.
 
 Time's on our side, though it's creeping so slow.
 Your jasmine and segas with grow.
 Osprey, palmetto, and grasses that flow,
 I long for Florida so.
 
 I've been to Rio, and Paris, and Rome.
 A man could love them all, I guess.
 You send me photos of palm trees and home,
 A century plant and a kiss.
 
 I call at sunset, you paint me her glow.
 Walking alone isn't fun though.
 White sand is drifting.  Your practice will show,
 My Florida virtuoso.
 
 Time's on our side, though it's creeping so slow.
 Your jasmine and segas with grow.
 Osprey, palmetto, and grasses that flow,
 I long for Florida so.
 
 Oleander morning, the dew covers all.
 No one's sleeping in today.
 Walk the beach at sunrise, first day home.
 Florida I'm back to stay.
