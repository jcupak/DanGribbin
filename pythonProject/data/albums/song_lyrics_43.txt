 						LEMME BE YOUR KINGFISHER
 
 Kingfisher sittin? on a telephone wire.
 He knows why I?m a-callin? you, he knows I?m on fire.
 He swoops down to catch a fish, he knows what to do;
 He knows what I?m a-wantin? babe is nothin? but you.
 
 If I could be a kingfisher, I?d be king of this stream;
 I could fish where I wanted, I could dream a big dream.
 But I?m just a man wantin? nothing? but you;
 Lemme be your kingfisher, lemme dream for two.
 
 Kingfisher waitin? on a nice juicy trout.
 He says you know I love you, but you?ve got a little doubt.
 Won?t you ask Mother Kingfisher, she?ll tell you true,
 That I ain?t been catchin? nothing? cause I wanna catch you.
 
 If I could be a kingfisher, I?d be king of this stream;
 I could fish where I wanted, I could dream a big dream.
 But I?m just a man wantin? nothing? but you;
 Lemme be your kingfisher, lemme dream for two.
 
 Kingfisher, kingfisher, sittin? on a wire;
 He can fly that high, maybe not much higher.
 Lemme fly so high, lemme fly so true.
 Lemme be your kingfisher be my queenfisher, too.
 
 If I could be a kingfisher, I?d be king of this stream;
 I could fish where I wanted to and dream a big dream.
 But I?m just a man wantin? nothing? but you;
 Lemme be your kingfisher, lemme dream for two.
 
 Kingfisher sittin? on a telephone wire.
 He knows why I?m a-callin? you, he knows I?m on fire.
 He swoops down to catch a fish, he knows what to do;
 He knows what I?m a-wantin? babe is nothing? but you.
 Nothin? but you.
 Lemme be your kingfisher, be my queenfisher, too.
 Lemme be your kingfisher, be my queenfisher, too.
