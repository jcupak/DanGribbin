 						The whole wide world sings one sweet song, can you hear it?
 Relax and let your ragtime rhythm roll.
 The notes come each by each,
 Like shells upon the beach.
 The melody is written on your soul.
 
 One sweet song, there's no way to sing it wrong.
 The spirit flowing through us runs so strong.
 One sweet song, won't you stay and sing along.
 Together we can harmonize till dawn.
 
 The world comes on like a big bad wolf, don't fear it.
 Just pick your path and toss that dog a bone.
 If he huffs and puffs at you, well, let him huff till he turns blue.
 Your business ain't nobody's but your own.
 
 One sweet song, there's no way to sing it wrong.
 The spirit flowing through us runs so strong.
 One sweet song, won't you stay and sing along.
 Together we can harmonize till dawn.
 
 When other currents pull too strong and start to bully me along,
 Well I've got to find a way to paddle free.
 For there's wondrous life to live, a chance to take, a chance to give,
 And I'm bound to take a chance on being me.
 
 The song we sing can heal the heart, can you feel it?
 The music moves us with its soothing touch.
 A lullaby at night, even the blues can set us right.
 Sounds so true we just can't get enough.
 
 Of that one sweet song, there's no way to sing it wrong.
 The spirit flowing through us runs so strong.
 One sweet song, won't you stay and sing along.
 Together we can harmonize till dawn.
 The whole wide world is singing one sweet song.
 It's been so good to know you, now, so long.
