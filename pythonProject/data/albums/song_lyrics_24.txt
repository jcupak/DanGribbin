 						BAD CHOLESTEROL
 
 I'm a victim of the latest, buckin' for a status
 Well beyond the level any man can maintain.
 My motives are material, my methods mainly serially
 Criminal beyond the point I could sustain.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 The bad cholesterol is stickin' to my brain.
 
 I'm not a person you can count on; Lord, the things I've weaseled out on.
 Worked a lifetime to avoid responsibility.
 I'm on my thirty-seventh comeback, bound on gettin' some back,
 Before they take my .38 away from me.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 The bad cholesterol's attackin' both my knees.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 I won't be livin' long enough to pay his fee.
 
 I'm the guy your momma warned ya would come 'round lookin' for ya;
 I've got everything your little heart desires and less.
 I look a little bit like Popeye; yeah, my smile's a little cockeyed;
 My engine's runnin' rough, my crankshaft is a mess.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 The bad cholesterol's collectin' in my chest.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 My psychiatric profile's got him so depressed.
 
 There's little hope of my survival; just tryin' to stay alive'll
 Take a miracle, cause I've been rubbed against the grain.
 With a dozen different ailments, I'm careenin' toward derailment;
 There's a storm within my system that's a hurricane.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 My laboratory readings just went down the drain.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feeling low because
 My health insurance carrier has denied all claims.
 I'm a mass of rotten phobias; my doctor's feelin' low because
 The bad cholesterol is stickin' to my brain.
