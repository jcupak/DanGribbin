 						NOTHIN? DOIN?             
 
 I went to ask my baby to go out with me;
 She said she?d check her schedule, I should wait and see.
 I told her nothin? doin?.  Don?t want no run around.
 Now I don?t get no action, but a man?s gotta stand his ground.
 
 I went to see my grocer for a loaf of bread;
 He sold me half-stale biscuit full of nine-point lead.
 I told him nothin? doin?.  He said, ?You win or lose.?
 I?ve got the Wonder Bread munchies and the Supermarket Blues.
 
 	Yeah, the world?s got a chip on its shoulder for me,
 	And it ain?t gonna grant me a dime.
 	I?m gonna catch me a break, now, you wait and see,
 	It just never quite comes my time.
 
 Now, I asked my boss could I have a raise;
 He said: ?We ain?t got money.?  Could I live on praise?
 I told him nothin? doin?.  I only work for cash.
 He understood me perfect.  Now I?m collectin? trash.
 
 I went to see my mama for a piece of pie;
 She said the mixer?s busted and the oven died.
 And now there?s nothin? doin? between the mother and son.
 If I don?t get my pie, well, I?m a mean-tempered son of a gun.
 
 Went to the St. Johns River, but the bridge was up;
 I tried to swim across, a gator grabbed my cuff.
 I told him nothin? doin?.  He sorta grinned at me.
 Now I?ve got gator-tooth freckles from my head down to my knees.
 
 	Yeah, the world?s got a chip on its shoulder for me,
 	And it ain?t gonna grant me a dime.
 	I?m gonna catch me a break, now, you wait and see,
 	It just never quite comes my time.
 
 Down at the bank the teller thought she?d seen my mug;
 She went to call the sheriff, now I?m in the jug.
 I told him nothin? doin?.  He threw the book at me.
 I?m doin? six to ten, now--one . . . two, three, four, five  six to ten, now,
 In the penitentiary.
