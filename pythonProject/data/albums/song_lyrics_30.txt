 						AT THE AQUARIUM				
 
 Can you come, can you come, can you come, can you come.
 
 It's a fine day at the aquarium, but there's trouble back at the zoo.
 The spoonbill keeper stuck a fork in her thumb,
 And her face is turning blue.
 
 Can you come, can you come, can you come, can you come.
 
 It's a fine day at the aquarium, pandaemonium at the zoo.
 Come a river otter, leatherback, ibis, owl--
 Gotta figure out what to do.
 
 Can you come, can you come, can you come, can you come.
 
 It's a fine day at the aquarium, and the owl has a likely plan.
 The peacock has a magnificent tail;
 He could use it as a fan.
 
 Can you come, can you come, can you come, can you come.
 
 Sit the keeper down on a tree stump round, let the peacock swish his tail.
 Oh, there's never a finer sight to be found
 As that blue face turning pale.
 
 Can you come, can you come, can you come, can you come.
 
 It's a fine day at the aquarium, a better day at the zoo.
 The spoonbill keeper has her rosy cheeks,
 And the peacock's tail is blue..
 
 Can you come, can you come, can you come, can you come.
 
 On a fine day at the aquarium, if your face is turning blue,
 Come a river otter, leatherback, ibis, owl,
 And a peacock will fan you.
