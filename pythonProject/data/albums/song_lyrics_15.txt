 						LILY OF BERMUDA			
 
 There's a flower that blossoms in the ocean.
 An island so far from other lands.
 I'm here to tell you of the beauty of that island,
 Of Bermuda's blue waters and pink sands.
 
 A lily blossoms on the hillsides of the island.
 She blooms where she's planted on the shore.
 Fresh on the breeze, she's my Lily of Bermuda.
 Won't be leaving this island any more.
 
 I spent a long time looking elsewhere for my fortune.
 Should have stayed here with my Lily in my arms.
 But now I'm home and my Bermuda prayer's been answered.
 My fortune's in my Lily and her charms.
 
 Lily walks me 'long the South Shore when it's sunny.
 Blows me kisses on St. David's from the light.
 We sail the harbor in my dinghy every Sunday afternoon.
 Her lullabye of Bermuda cools my nights.
 
 There's a flower that blossoms in the ocean.
 An island so far from other lands.
 I'm here to tell you of the beauty of that island,
 Of Bermuda's blue waters and pink sands.
