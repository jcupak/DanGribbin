 						This is a morning made for Martha,
 The marbled clouds awash in pink.
 A sliver moon she's carved in ivory,
 A veil of mist too pure to drink.
 
 But when will Martha come, when will we wade the rising tide?
 Oh, when will Martha come--when will she walk here by my side?
 
 We've known our share of disappointments;
 Leaving our better selves behind.
 I've walked away from what I needed;
 She's helped me see that I was blind.
 
 And when will Martha come?  Shore birds are waiting to rejoice.
 Yes, when will Martha come--when will we hear her laughing voice?
 
 This is an evening made for Martha,
 A copper sunset in the West.
 Against a silhouette of palm trees
 The evening star has reached its crest.
 
 But when will Martha come, to name the stars I count each night?
 Oh, when will Martha come--when will this darkness know her light?
 
 This was a morning made for Martha,
 The marbled clouds awash in pink.
 A sliver moon she's carved in ivory,
 A veil of mist too pure to drink.
