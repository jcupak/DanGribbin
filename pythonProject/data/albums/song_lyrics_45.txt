 What is time but the stream I go a-fishing in?
 What is time but the heron in the sky?
 What is time but the years I've wasted chasing it?
 But now it's time; oh, yes, it's time.
 
 Time for glimpses in the ripples at the water's edge.
 Time to listen to the heartbeat of a friend.
 Time to taste the essence of a woodland breeze,
 To feel the peace that loving arms extend.
 
 I have arrived.  I am home.  I am here.  Peace is now.
 I have arrived.  I am home.  Peace is now.
 
 What is time but the stilling of the anxious voice
 Once the fear of full awakening is gone?
 What is time but standing tall before a universe
 In the full and brave acceptance of the dawn?
 
 Between the ocean of the past and apprehension
 For tempests that the future may bring on
 Lies a deep and hidden valley of compassion,
 For the present moment's strength to draw upon.
 
 I have arrived.  I am home.  I am here.  Peace is now.
 I have arrived.  I am home.  Peace is now.
