 						The Little Blue Heron doesn't get much press; he's second on the family tree. 
 The Great Blue Heron has the marquee name; Little Blue's in obscurity. 
 When he wakes in the morning, he won't be great, but I'm telling him he shouldn't feel down.  
 There's lots of folks make a big difference in life, without getting great reknown.
 
 'Cause it's the size of the heart that's the measure of the bird; 
 You can brighten your world with a smile.  
 You can find yourself running at the head of the pack,
 When you're walking that extra mile.     
 
 The Little Blue Heron saw a turtle in the lake; he was caught in a big fish net.   
 "You!  Call for some help!" said the snappy old grouch; "I believe you're afraid to get wet."  
 The Little Blue Heron didn't have much voice, and besides there was no one in sight.  
 So he picked at the net for an hour or so; then he picked on into the night.     
 
 That turtle prattled on about his dismal fate, while the Little Blue stuck to his guns.  
 "If you'll snap that last piece of netting," he said, "I believe you'll find that we're done."  
 The turtle never even offered one word of thanks, just grumbled as he floated from sight.  
 But the Spirit that rules in the Great Blue Sky  smiled a Little Blue smile that night.
 
 It's the size of the heart that's the measure of the bird; 
 You can brighten your world with a smile.  
 You can find yourself running at the head of the pack,
 When you're walking that extra mile.     
 
 The Little Blue Heron doesn't get much press; he's second on the family tree.  
 The Great Blue Heron has the marquee name; Little Blue's in obscurity.  
 When he wakes in the morning, he won't be great, but I'm thinking he understands.  
 No time to wait around for a pat on the back, when you're lending a helping hand.
 
 It's the size of the heart that's the measure of the bird; 
 You can brighten your world with a smile.  
 You can find yourself running at the head of the pack,
 When you're walking that extra mile . . . 
 walking that extra mile . . . walking that extra mile.
