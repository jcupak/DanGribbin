PETE SEEGER IN PARADISE
© 2016 by Daniel V. Gribbin

I could hear Pete Seeger yesterday, he was up there chopping wood.
He had the angels singing folk songs, as only that man could.
Pete said: "I'm chopping wood to warm some folks we've come to know too well.
That's right, I'm privileged to chop this wood to stoke the fires in Hell."
 
"This wood's for racist, goons, and bigots, the scabs who stole our jobs,
The bombers of the churches, and the lynchers in the mobs.
Cowards threw the stones at Peekskill.
Cowards spewed McCarthy's spawn.
Here's some wood to roast their chestnuts as the devil eggs them on."

[Chorus] 
Pete said: "I always have enjoyed a little woodchopping at dawn.
And this firewood here in heaven, it's the best I've come upon.
They say it warms a fellow twice, you know, each stick of wood I split.
Well I'm warmed up enough to stick it to those thugs who gave us fits."
 
[Repeat chorus.]
 
"Oh, they could squeeze me with their blacklist.
They could find me in contempt.
But my innermost convictions would always be exempt
From the prying eyes of Congress, NSA or FBI.
If we seek the truth and sing the truth, the truth will never die."
 
"I paid a heavy price for my alleged crimes against the state.
But the judgment of the common folk will always vindicate
A man who stands behind his principles and sings an honest song.
When we all pitch in together, then we're pitching twice as strong"
 
[Repeat chorus with the following additional line]
"A few hot coals to roast their chestnuts, as the devil eggs them on."
